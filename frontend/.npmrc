# Disable engine strict checks to allow Node 22 to run packages that may
# specify older Node versions in their package.json engines field
engine-strict=false

# Disable npm workspace detection - critical for CI/monorepo environments
# This prevents npm from looking upward for workspace configuration
workspaces=false
