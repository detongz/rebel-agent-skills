Verify a smart contract on Monad using Foundry

Once your contract is deployed to a live network, the next step is to verify its source code on the block explorer.

Verifying a contract means uploading its source code, along with the settings used to compile the code, to a repository (typically maintained by a block explorer). This allows anyone to compile it and compare the generated bytecode with what is deployed on chain. Doing this is extremely important in an open platform like Monad.

In this guide we'll explain how to do this using Foundry.

WARNING

Please make sure your forge version is v1.5.0 and above.

You can check the version of forge by running

forge --version
Mainnet
Testnet
Foundry Monad template (Recommended)
Default Foundry Project
NOTE

The foundry-monad template is configured for testnet by default. To use mainnet, update your foundry.toml file:

Change eth-rpc-url="https://testnet-rpc.monad.xyz" to your mainnet RPC URL
Change chain_id = 10143 to 143

If you are using foundry-monad template, you can use the commands below based on your preferred block explorer:

MonadVision
Monadscan
Socialscan
forge verify-contract \
    <contract_address> \
    <contract_name> \
    --chain 143 \
    --verifier sourcify \
    --verifier-url https://sourcify-api-monad.blockvision.org/

Example:

forge verify-contract \
    0x8fEc29BdEd7A618ab6E3CD945456A79163995769 \
    Counter \
    --chain 143 \
    --verifier sourcify \
    --verifier-url https://sourcify-api-monad.blockvision.org/

On successful verification of smart contract, you should get a similar output in your terminal:

Start verifying contract `0x8fEc29BdEd7A618ab6E3CD945456A79163995769` deployed on monad-mainnet
Attempting to verify on Sourcify. Pass the --etherscan-api-key <API_KEY> to verify on Etherscan, or use the --verifier flag to verify on another provider.


Submitting verification for [Counter] "0x8fEc29BdEd7A618ab6E3CD945456A79163995769".
Contract successfully verified

Now check the contract on MonadVision.
