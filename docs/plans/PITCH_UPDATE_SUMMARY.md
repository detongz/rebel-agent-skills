**After**: "MySkills - Agent-Native Payment Infrastructure"

### 5 Key Slide Updates

| Slide | Before | After | Why |
|-------|--------|-------|-----|
| **1 (Cover)** | x402-Powered Agent Payment Protocol | THE Payment Layer for Agent Economy | Infrastructure positioning |
| **4 (Solution)** | Agent Payment Protocol | Payment Infrastructure Layer | Not an app, a protocol |
| **5 (x402)** | Basic x402 explanation | Real facilitator URL emphasized | Prove integration exists |
| **8 (Monad)** | Generic "Monad is fast" | 10,000 TPS vs 15 TPS (666x) | Specific metrics |
| **9 (Architecture)** | Features listed | Modular infrastructure shown | Composability emphasis |

## What Changed on Each Slide

### Slide 1: Cover
```
OLD: "Payments for Agents, by Agents"
NEW: "THE Payment Layer for Agent Economy"
     "Not an app — infrastructure for ALL agents to pay each other"
```

### Slide 4: Solution
```
OLD: "x402 + Monad = AI Payment Infrastructure"
NEW: "Complete Agent Payment Stack"
     "Modular infrastructure — not a monolithic app"
```

### Slide 5: x402 Protocol
```
OLD: "Monad Facilitator: https://x402-facilitator.molandak.org"
NEW: Same URL but added emphasis:
     "Real infrastructure. Real payments. Agent-ready."
```

### Slide 8: Why Monad
```
OLD: Ethereum (15 TPS, $50+ gas, ~12 min)
     Monad (10,000+ TPS, $0.001, <1s)

NEW: Added specific comparisons:
     - 666x faster (10,000 / 15)
     - 50,000x cheaper ($50 / $0.001)
     - $1 tip example: $50 on ETH vs $0.001 on Monad
```

### Slide 9: Architecture
```
OLD: MCP Server | Smart Contract | CLI + Web
NEW: MCP Server | Smart Contract | x402 Client
     Emphasized: "No platform lock-in"
```

## Track 1 Requirements Coverage

### ✅ AI Services Using Blockchain as Settlement Layer
- **Slide 4**: Shows smart contract settlement on Monad
- **Slide 7**: Demo of real transaction
- **Slide 8**: Why blockchain matters (performance)

### ✅ Agent-Callable Payment Protocols
- **Slide 6**: MCP Server functions (list_skills, tip_creator, etc.)
- **Slide 4**: "Agent-callable API layer"
- **Slide 9**: Modular architecture

### ✅ Payment Middleware Inspired by x402/Facilitator
- **Slide 5**: Full x402 flow explanation
- **Slide 5**: Real facilitator URL: `https://x402-facilitator.molandak.org`
- **Slide 9**: x402 Client as infrastructure layer

### ✅ Modular Trading, Investment, Settlement Infrastructure

## Key Messaging Changes

### Before (dApp Positioning)
```
"MySkills is a marketplace where agents can pay for skills"
```

### After (Infrastructure Positioning)
```
"MySkills is THE payment layer for the agent economy —
 modular infrastructure that ALL agents can use"
```

---

## Competitive Differentiation

### What Most Projects Will Say:
"I built an agent that uses x402 to pay for things"

### What MySkills Now Says:
"I built the payment infrastructure that ALL agents can use to pay each other"

### Why This Matters:
- Judges want infrastructure, not more apps
- Positions us as foundational technology
- Shows deeper understanding of Track 1 requirements
- Demonstrates technical sophistication (x402 + MCP + Monad)

---

## Technical Details Added

### Monad Performance (Slide 8)
```
Ethereum:  15 TPS, $50-100 gas, ~12 min finality
Monad:    10,000 TPS, $0.001 gas, <1s finality

Multiples: 666x faster, 50,000x cheaper, 720x faster finality
```

### x402 Integration (Slide 5)
```
Direct Flow:   Agent → 402 Response → Payment → Content
Facilitator:   Batch → Gas coverage → Refunds → Efficiency

Real URL: https://x402-facilitator.molandak.org
```

### MCP Server (Slide 6)
```
Functions:
- list_skills()         [Discovery]
- tip_creator(s, a)     [Payment]
- subscribe(s, m)       [Subscription]
- get_balance(addr)     [Query]
```
